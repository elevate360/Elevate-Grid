# Elevate-Grid
A super fancy, mobile first, responsive CSS grid. 

This SASS powered grid framework gives you all the structure you need to build mobile first websites / web apps. 


##Overall Idea / Purpose
The point of this framework is to provide a simple CSS class based sytem to create breakpoint dependent layouts.

You can use this framework to write classes that dictate how your layout falls depending on your breakpoint, e.g spanning 12 columns on mobile but 5 on medium profiles. 

In addition to these width layouts, there are also helper classes to manage margings, paddings and aspect ratios on a breakpoint basis (e.g small vertical padding on mobile but huge padding on large)
 

##Getting Started
To get this all to work you need a SASS project. Once you have that you need to import both the _grid.scss and _structure.scss files. These work in combination and could be placed inside one partial if you want to.

Once compiled you should be able to use the following classes
